we
wish
to
find
frequency
of
each
word
in
a
text
naturally
the
text
is
too
large
to
read
into
main
memory
so
sorting
and
counting
is
an
intractable
approach
fortunately
the
number
of
distinct
words
is
small
enough
that
we
don
t
have
to
resort
to
elaborate
solutions
since
we
want
to
emit
the
word
list
in
alphabetical
order
a
binary
search
tree
is
just
the
ticket
to
keep
things
simple
you
may
assume
the
input
file
has
been
preprocessed
so
there
is
one
word
per
line
with
no
extraneous
punctuation
write
a
program
that
reads
the
word
list
from
standard
input
and
outputs
the
words
in
alphabetical
order
preceeded
by
frequency
count
